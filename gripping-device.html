        The Get-A-Grip device was designed for individuals with limited grip strength to engage in weight training and pulling exercises at the gym. My role in this senior design project focused on creating a reliable locking mechanism that enables users to disengage from exercise equipment with a consistent 1-pound wrist rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led CAD development in SolidWorks, performed dynamic simulations, and used FEA to ensure structural integrity with a 3x safety factor. The gripping device supports loads up to 600 lbs and features a single-handed mounting and release mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project exemplifies my strength in accessible product design, simulation-based validation, and user-centric engineering.
