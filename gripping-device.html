      <p>
        The Get-A-Grip arm brace is designed to revolutionize strength training for individuals with compromised grip strength. It exceeds industry safety standards and implements an easy-to-use mechanism that assists users in gripping bars. Users simply wraps the attached green strap around a barbell or dumbell and locks the strap in place using an internal safety mechanism below the wrist. 
        This mechanism can be locked and unlocked by lightly pushing up the integrated bar above the wrist.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        In a world where grip strength diminishes drastically with age and disease, the fitness industry lacks adequate technology to allow those affected to utilize gym equipment safely.
        Unfortunately, current prior art on the market falls short as they disallow the user from easily detaching themselves from the barbell or dumbell. 
        Additionally, they dont offer a 360 degree hold around the bar for full range of motion exercises.

        <h2>Finite Element Analysis & Material Selection</h2>

        <p>Finite Element Analysis was conducted on the main load baring components: Ratcheting Pawl, Toothed Plate, and Locking Rod
          Mesh convergence was conducted on each part to ensure reliable and accurate simulation results.
          The material of 4340 steel alloy was selected due to its high yield strength of 740-1860 MPa.
          The Factor of Safety of 3 was achieved for all parts in accordance with ASTM gym equipment standards.
          
          Note that FEA was conducted throughout the design process. Simulation results were used to inform iterative design choices and final geometries.
