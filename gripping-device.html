      This adaptive gym device was developed for individuals with limited hand function. I led the design of a locking mechanism that allows users to easily release the bar with just a twist of the wrist. The device supports loads up to 600 lbs and ensures safety through FEA simulations and a 3x safety factor. CAD was developed in SolidWorks, with multiple prototypes tested for ease of use and reliability.
