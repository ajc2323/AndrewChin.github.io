      <h2>MyHand-RLX</h2>

      <p>
        The MyHand-RLX incorporates small scale vibration motors into the MyHand Robot.
        I developed a modular mounting system for the vibration motors centralizing and strengthening
        electrical connections. This decreased robot don and doff times during patient testing session 
        and ensured connections were robust enough to endure testing procedures and transportation.

      <h2>The MyHand Orthosis Robot</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/vibe-motor/myhand.gif" alt="MyHand Robot Action" class="hero-image"/>
      <p>
        The MyHand Orthosis Robot is a stroke rehabilitative device which allows patients 
        to regain the dextrous ability of their hands and fingers to grip and hold objects.
        The robot attaches to the users DIP and PIP segments and extends the fingers via a pulley system. 
        The EMG arm band reads and interprets the microvolt signals of the arm via a machine learning algortihm
        to open and close the hand based on the patients' input.

      <h3>Results & Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        The final mount reduced transmitted vibration by over 60% in the target frequency range (10–80 Hz). Its modularity allows adaptation to various devices, and future iterations may include tunable damping using magnetorheological fluid or smart elastomers.
