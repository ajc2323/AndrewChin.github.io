      <p>
        The MyHand-RLX incorporates small scale vibration motors into the MyHand Robot.
        I developed a modular mounting system for the vibration motors centralizing and strengthening
        electrical connections. This decreased robot don and doff times during patient testing session 
        and ensured connections were robust enough to endure testing procedures and transportation.

      <p>
        Excessive vibration in precision equipment can lead to mechanical wear, signal noise, and reduced performance. This project focused on developing a compact, modular vibration isolation mount for sensitive devices. The goal was to design a solution that is lightweight, easily integrated, and capable of damping low-frequency vibrations.

      <h3>Results & Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        The final mount reduced transmitted vibration by over 60% in the target frequency range (10–80 Hz). Its modularity allows adaptation to various devices, and future iterations may include tunable damping using magnetorheological fluid or smart elastomers.
