      <h2>MyHand-RLX</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/vibe-motor/full-robot-assem.png" alt="Vibration Isolation Mount" class="project-banner"/>
      <p>
        The MyHand-RLX incorporates small scale vibration motors into the MyHand Robot.
        I developed a modular mounting system for the vibration motors centralizing and strengthening
        electrical connections. This decreased robot don and doff times during patient testing session 
        and ensured connections were robust enough to endure testing procedures and transportation.

      <h2>The MyHand Orthosis Robot</h2>
      <img src="assets/images/vibe-motor/myhand.gif" alt="MyHand Robot Action" class="hero-image"/>
      <p>
        The MyHand Orthosis Robot is a stroke rehabilitative device which allows patients 
        to regain the dextrous ability of their hands and fingers to grip and hold objects.
        The robot attaches to the users DIP and PIP segments and extends the fingers via a pulley system. 
        The EMG arm band reads and interprets the microvolt signals of the arm via a machine learning algortihm
        to open and close the hand based on the patients' input.

        <h3>Patient Usage</h3>
        <p>
          Stroke patients often experience high levels of spcticity in their hands where the muscles within 
          the hand and arm become extremely stiff. This causes involuntary contraction leading to clenched fists, limited finger movement 
          and overall impairment within their daily lives.

      <h2>Incorporating Vibration</h2>
      <p>
        With their Touché Glove, the Stanfrod CHARM lab demonstrated that vibration pulses applied at random intervals and periods worked to 
        provide patients with spacticity relief. In partnership with the CHARM lab, we worked to incorporate the glove's vibration 
        motors and controller into the MyHand Orthosis Robot.

      <p>
        The original integration worked, but it was bulky and difficult to assemble onto the patient around the already donned MyHand Robot. 
        Further when the MyHand Robot opened the patients' hand the palm and fingers consistently lost contact with the vibration motors.
        Note tha the Touché Glove was originally designed for and tested on patients with hands in a closed state rather than open.

      <h2>Refining the Vibration Motor Integration</h2>

      <p>
        Version 2 worked to localize a single vibration motor to each finger, as well as, 
        integrate the motors within the straps used to bind the robot to the patients' hand. 
        This bypassed the need for the Touché Glove, decreasing the bulk and alowing for constant contact between the fingers and motors. 
        However, due to the messy and very long electrical connections, the vibration motors were prone to breaking and putting the robot 
        onto the patients hands became extremely tedious and time consuming which is an issue within the time constrained patient sessions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new version of the MyHand-RLX Orthosis Robot solves these issued with a modular vibratior motor mounting system.

      <h3>Results & Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        The final mount reduced transmitted vibration by over 60% in the target frequency range (10–80 Hz). Its modularity allows adaptation to various devices, and future iterations may include tunable damping using magnetorheological fluid or smart elastomers.
