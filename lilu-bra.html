      At Lilu, I developed a smart bra prototype that integrates pressure sensors to monitor lactation. I researched, sourced, and tested a range of flexible sensors, designed test jigs, and created circuits using Arduino, amplifiers, and filters. The goal was to find a sensor that provided reliable pressure data during pumping without compromising comfort or wearability.
