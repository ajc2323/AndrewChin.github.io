      <h2 id="overview">Lilu Inc.</h2>

      Lilu Inc. is a small startup which aims to innovation and revolutionize the maternal healthcare space, specifically with respect to breastfeeding and pumping health and care. 
      I have been working at Lilu Inc. for the past year and a half where I began as an Engineering Intern and am now the Lead Product Engineer. I have contribbuted to the development of
      Lilu Inc.'s smart bra and wearble breast pump, leading the team with my expertise in rapid prototyping, CAD expertise (most notably in SolidWorks), and electro-mechanical planning and assembly.

      <p>
        As a Engineering Intern at Lilu Inc., I worked on the early-stage development of a Smart Sensing Bra system intended to detect pressure and strain signals during lactation.
        Through extensive research I identified potential felxible and fabric pressure and strain sensors. To characterize the performance of these sensors, I designed custom test jigs 
        to test accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity.

      <h2 id="sensor-research">Smart Bra Custom Test Jigs</h2>
      <p>
        To evaluate strain sensor performance, I designed a custom jig where one end of the sensor was zip-tied to a fixed metal base and the other to the retractable piston of a linear actuator. 
        Care was taken to ensure the sensor remained taut without pre-strain. The linear actuator, powered and controlled by an Arduino Uno and motor driver, retracted at a constant 10 mm/s, elongating the sensor over time. 
        A simple voltage divider circuit enabled real-time voltage readings across the sensor, captured via the Arduino’s analog pin and converted from raw values to voltages within the sketch. Simultaneously, elongation was 
        calculated based on elapsed time and actuator velocity, providing a continuous mapping of strain to output voltage. Both datasets were logged in tandem for downstream analysis.

        <h3 id="pressure-jig">Pressure Jig Design & Protocol</h3>

        <p>
          To characterize pressure sensor performance, I developed a custom test jig featuring a linear actuator, syringe, and water receptacle to apply a controlled compressive load. 
          As the actuator extends, water is displaced from the syringe into the receptacle, exerting a load on the pressure sensor; retraction removes the load. A load cell placed beneath the 
          sensor serves as a ground truth reference, capturing the actual force applied. Using an Arduino Uno, I controlled the actuator’s motion and simultaneously logged real-time load cell 
          data and pressure sensor voltage outputs. This setup enabled continuous cycling and synchronized data collection for downstream analysis.

        <h3 id="sensor-eval">Sensor Evaluation & Testing</h3>
        <p>
          I designed test protocols and circuits using Arduino microcontrollers to benchmark sensor behavior under compressive loading.
          Using amplifier and filter circuits, I quantified signal quality, sensitivity, and noise across sensor candidates.
          Data was collected using the serial monitor and visualized in real-time using Python plotting scripts.

      <p>
        I developed several custom jigs to evaluate sensor response to localized compression and stretch.
        These jigs featured modular inserts to accommodate various sensor sizes, applied loads using weighted sliders, and provided reliable test repeatability.

      <p>
        I translated electrical sensor layouts into physical prototypes, integrating selected sensors into textile samples.
        This included iterative prototyping with sewable contacts, signal routing, and comfort optimization for wearability.
        I also collaborated with the firmware team to align sensor outputs with massage logic and assisted in packaging layouts.
