    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a mechanical engineer and product designer with a passion for creating solutions that are both technically sound and human-centered. I completed a dual-degree program in Physics at the College of the Holy Cross and Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, where I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work experience spans startups, research labs, and government facilities. I’ve led product development at Lilu Inc., where I engineered smart breastfeeding devices, and supported in-house manufacturing projects at Tobyhanna Army Depot using Creo and SolidWorks. At Columbia, I’ve contributed to experimental systems at the RoAM Lab and tackled sustainability through user-focused design in the Human-Centered Design & Innovation program.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stand out as an engineer for my ability to blend creativity with technical rigor. Whether it’s translating a conceptual sketch into a manufacturable prototype or balancing user needs with design constraints, I bring thoughtful problem-solving, iterative prototyping, and a systems-thinking mindset to every project. I'm skilled in CAD, FEA, rapid prototyping, and embedded systems—and I’m always eager to build what hasn’t been built yet.
