      I helped translate industrial design into engineering realities by optimizing the internal layout of a wearable breast pump. I modified tolerances for 3D-printed parts, ensured compact placement of motors and electronics, and worked with vendors to iterate designs quickly. I also contributed to firmware development for massage and suction functionality.
