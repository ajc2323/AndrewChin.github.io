    <p>
      As part of Columbia's Human-Centered Design & Innovation course, my team and I tackled the challenge of reducing plastic waste in consumer packaging.
      Through user interviews, environmental impact mapping, and design research, we identified key opportunities to improve sustainability in everyday habits. 
      We developed a prototype of a modular, reusable refill station designed for high-traffic urban environments. 
      I focused on the physical design and prototyping of the refill unit, using CAD modeling and iterative feedback from user testing to refine usability. 
      The project emphasized systems thinking, empathy-driven design, and lifecycle sustainability.
