        <p>
            As part of the ROAM Lab at Columbia University, within the Myhand Orthosis Robot project, cx I characterized and assessed the accuracy of trakstar sensor performance within close proximity of one another. 
            Through my experimentation and data analysis, utilizing ROS, RViz and Python within a Linux environment, I was able to identify a configuration of trakstar sensors which not only decreased the 
            sensor footprint within the MyHand Robot by 75% and improve joint angle reporting accuracy to within 5 degrees.

      <h2 id="trakstar-sensors">The Trakstar Sensors</h2>

      <p>
        The trakstar sensors are small scale electromagnetic 6DOF tracking sensors that offer higher accuracy and precision over commonly used imu’s as they measure position 
        and orientation without the presence of drift. 
      </p>

      </div>

      <p> 
        These sensors record and publish their position and orientation within ROS to the TF Topic in the form of transforms relative to the trakstar base. 
        The images shown here depict the actual position and orientation of the sensors as well as their the transforms visualized in Rviz. 
        By reading in the transforms of each sensor we are able to calculate the relative angles between trakstar0 and trakstar1 and trakstar1 and trakstar2.

        <p>
          Our studies have shown that when the MyHand Orthosis Robot actively opens the patient's hand, the fingers 
          exhibits a degree of stiffness which has prevented the hand from opening unders normal operating conditions. 
          We aimed to calculate this stiffness as a function of joint level torque of the finger, measured and calculated using the load cell, divided by its angular displacement. 
          Therefore, the trakstar sensors are used to measure the angular displacment of the joints as a function of time.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          To measure the PIP and MCP joint angles overtime, trakstar sensors are placed at the base of the hand, the MCP and the PIP segment. 
          This creates a kinematic chain which I used to calculate the relative joint angles within Python.

      <h2 id="prob-stat">Problem Statement</h2>

      <p>
        There are 3 problem areas/questions that need to be addressed and explored:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The trakstar sensors are accurate when used individually. But do they exhibit the same level of accuracy 
            when multiple sensors are used in close proximity to one another?
          </li>
          <li>
            There are multiple trakstar sensors of varying sizes that can be used. What combination of the sensors 
            provides the optimal balance of overall form factor and accuracy?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will these sensors be integrated into the MyHand Orthosis Robot that streamlines assembly and does not 
            negatively affect robot functionality?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="bubble">
        <h3 id="testing-accuracy">Characterizing Trakstar Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
          To characterize the accuracy of the sensors, I designed a custom test jig which replicated relative distance and orientation between sensors 
          when situated upon the patient's finger. The jig features a peg board system allowing the sensors to be fixed at speciied incremental angles while remaining coplanar.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The PIP angle - between trakstar1 and trakstar2 - was kept constant at 90 degrees. The mcp angle - between trakstar0 and trakstar1 - was then varied from 45, to 90 to 
          135 degrees with the goal to observe the error measured between the actual MCP and PIP angles.
        </p>

        <h3 id="optimal-config">Optimal Sensor Configuration</h3>
        <p>
          Using the custom test jig I determined the optimal configuration of the 3 avilable trakstar sensors:

        <p>
          Four configurations were tested as seen in the table below. The joint orientations and positions were recorded 
          as tranforms utilizing ROS and data analysis was conducted within Python to obtain the joint angles. Those angles were compared to the actual 
          angles and the error between the two were calculated and dsiplayed in the table below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at both the error and form factor of the individual sensors within each configuration, it was clear that the Cylindrical - Pill-Like - Pill-Like configuraion 
          would provide the most accurate results while minimizing the sensor footpring within the robot.
